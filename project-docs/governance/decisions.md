# TeamRadar Decision Register

## DEC-001 - Reconstruct Before Redesign

- **Date:** 2026-09-02
- **Status:** approved
- **Decision owner:** project owner
- **Decision:** Reconstruct what the old TeamRadar idea was from idea dumps,
  implemented legacy behavior, documents, and historical branches before
  changing the new project's specification, product boundary, and permitted-use
  boundary.
- **Reason:** The old concept is context, not an adequate new specification.
- **Alternatives considered:** begin implementation immediately or treat the
  memory reconstruction as current canon; neither was selected.
- **Consequences:** Current work is evidence gathering and organization only.
- **Affected records:** all records under `project-docs/legacy/` and
  `project-docs/evidence/`
- **Return condition:** owner reviews/corrects the reconstruction and explicitly
  begins new product planning.
- **Supersedes:** none
- **Superseded by:** none

## DEC-002 - Legacy Code Reuse Is Not Required

- **Date:** 2026-09-02
- **Status:** approved
- **Decision owner:** project owner
- **Decision:** The half-finished Laravel app may inform the rewrite, but the
  new project is not required to use or recycle its code, architecture,
  technology, data model, or boundaries.
- **Reason:** The owner expects to write the project again after reconsidering
  it.
- **Alternatives considered:** continue the legacy app or mandate selective
  reuse; neither is required.
- **Consequences:** Future choices require fresh authority and evidence.
- **Affected records:** all future briefs, specifications, plans, and code
- **Return condition:** future records cite current decisions, not legacy state.
- **Supersedes:** none
- **Superseded by:** none

## DEC-003 - Separate Workflow From Project Records

- **Date:** 2026-09-02
- **Status:** approved
- **Decision owner:** project owner
- **Decision:** Keep reusable workflows, management guidelines, procedures, and
  templates under `portable-project-workflow-system/`; keep TeamRadar-specific
  facts, decisions, guidelines, plans, and evidence under `project-docs/`.
- **Reason:** Prevent generic operating rules from becoming mixed with project
  content or silently importing project decisions.
- **Alternatives considered:** initialize TeamRadar records inside the portable
  package; rejected for this repository.
- **Consequences:** `AGENTS.md` links the two trees, while each tree keeps one
  responsibility.
- **Affected records:** `AGENTS.md`, `project-docs/`,
  `portable-project-workflow-system/`
- **Return condition:** repository review confirms no TeamRadar-specific record
  was added to the portable package.
- **Supersedes:** none
- **Superseded by:** none

## DEC-004 - Evidence And Completion Discipline

- **Date:** 2026-09-02
- **Status:** approved
- **Decision owner:** project owner
- **Decision:** Route work through the documented checklist, preserve unrelated
  work, separate facts/decisions/assumptions/proposals/questions/deferrals, and
  require evidence-backed completion.
- **Reason:** Explicit owner instruction.
- **Alternatives considered:** informal chat-only tracking; not selected.
- **Consequences:** Historical records and agent reports are evidence, not
  approval. Remote, destructive, production, publication, and history-rewrite
  actions require explicit authorization.
- **Affected records:** repository operating instructions and all task records
- **Return condition:** every substantive task identifies route, authority,
  verification, and residual risk.
- **Supersedes:** none
- **Superseded by:** none

## DEC-005 - Use The Repository Root As The Local Project Boundary

- **Date:** 2026-09-03
- **Status:** approved
- **Decision owner:** project owner
- **Decision:** Use `/Users/asime/Github/TeamRadarLaravel` as the primary local
  project folder and normal workspace boundary. Remove the broader
  `/Users/asime/Github` folder from the project. When a specific external path
  or operation is needed, the agent may request narrowly scoped access and the
  request will be reviewed for approval or rejection.
- **Reason:** Keep routine TeamRadar work focused and isolated without making
  legitimate, reviewed external access impossible.
- **Alternatives considered:** retain the entire GitHub parent as an attached
  workspace folder; not selected.
- **Consequences:** Repository commands must target the TeamRadar root. Sibling
  repositories and other external files are outside ordinary project scope.
  Approval for one external action does not authorize unrelated access or
  expand product scope.
- **Affected records:** `project-docs/current-state.md`, active task routes, and
  execution reports that rely on external files
- **Return condition:** revisit only if the project acquires a durable,
  documented dependency outside the repository.
- **Supersedes:** none
- **Superseded by:** none
