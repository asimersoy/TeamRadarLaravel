# TeamRadar Rewrite Owner Decision Sequence

- **Record type:** current owner-review packet
- **Status:** owner-input-required
- **Decision owner:** project owner
- **Created:** 2026-09-03
- **Update trigger:** after each owner decision or when new evidence changes a
  later decision dependency
- **Implementation authority:** none

## Purpose

This packet orders the decisions needed before an evidence-backed TeamRadar
implementation plan can exist. It is a decision agenda, not a product brief,
specification, roadmap, backlog, or authorization to write code.

The order intentionally settles product and permitted-use boundaries before
matching rules, data flows, architecture, or technology. After each owner
answer, the approved choice belongs in the decision register and the affected
open question is closed or narrowed. Unselected options remain proposals, not
rejected decisions, unless the owner explicitly rejects them.

## Evidence And Authority Separation

### Verified Current Facts

- The repository contains an unfinished Laravel prototype and extensive legacy
  evidence, not a completed current product.
- The legacy implementation did not complete functional matchmaking, private
  rooms, session correlation, reviews, honor, moderation, or production
  operations.
- The latest reachable code moved toward Valorant, while the later memory
  reconstruction describes an Apex return.
- No current stack, game, integration, data flow, decision system, deployment,
  or implementation boundary has been approved.

### Approved Owner Decisions Already In Force

- Reconstruct before redesign (`DEC-001`).
- Do not require reuse of legacy code, architecture, or technology (`DEC-002`).
- Keep reusable workflow records separate from TeamRadar records (`DEC-003`).
- Route work, preserve unrelated work, separate evidence classes, and require
  evidence-backed completion (`DEC-004`).
- Keep the canonical general workflow and TeamRadar-specific records separated
  inside the nested Git repository, with workspace-only sources, scratch,
  outputs, and snapshots outside Git (`DEC-006`).
- Protect the single canonical workflow from unapproved changes and put normal
  extensions in TeamRadar-specific records (`DEC-007`).
- Apply the approved TeamRadar workflow-governance contract for changes,
  approvals, specifications, commits, controlled operations, review batching,
  and reviewer authority (`DEC-008`).

### Unapproved Assumptions

The following may sound natural because of the old project, but each remains an
assumption until the owner decides it:

- TeamRadar remains a video-game teammate finder.
- The first game is Apex Legends or Valorant.
- Users enter a realtime queue rather than browse a directory or invite links.
- Rank, behavior, honor, reviews, reports, or session verification belong in
  the new product.
- A desktop relay, official game API, Redis, realtime sockets, Laravel, React,
  Node, or any particular database is needed.
- “Anti-toxicity,” “verified,” “safe,” or “compatible” can be promised publicly.

### Agent Proposal, Not A Decision

Use the staged sequence below and validate the smallest coherent product loop
before adding session surveillance, public reputation, automated eligibility,
or privileged integrations. This ordering keeps expensive and consequential
systems behind explicit evidence and owner gates. The owner may revise the
sequence.

## Gate 0 - Close Or Continue Legacy Reconstruction

### Decision Required

Is the current historical dossier sufficient context for redesign?

### Options

1. **Accept as sufficient context without claiming exhaustiveness
   (agent recommendation).** Keep the Apex/Valorant provenance conflict visible
   and begin a clean current-product charter.
2. **Request bounded corrections or deeper extraction.** Name the subsystem or
   historical claim that needs more work.
3. **Add more evidence first.** Supply another repository, branch, chat dump,
   screenshot, design, or correction before redesign begins.

### Effect

- Option 1 resolves the sufficiency gate in `OQ-003`. It can also close
  `OQ-001` if the owner states that no further evidence is currently being
  sought, without claiming that the reconstruction is exhaustive. `OQ-002`
  may remain a historical uncertainty that does not select the new game.
- Options 2 or 3 keep the reconstruction route active only for the named gap.

## Decision Group 1 - Current Product Charter And Use Boundary

Answer these before selecting a game, feature list, or stack:

1. What present-day problem does TeamRadar solve, in one sentence?
2. What outcome should a user achieve that ordinary game matchmaking, Discord,
   forums, or existing LFG tools do not provide well enough?
3. Which uses are permitted: one-session grouping, persistent teams, ranked
   play, casual play, communities, coaching, tournaments, or something else?
4. Which uses are explicitly outside the product?
5. Which promises must the product avoid—such as guaranteed compatibility,
   safety, verified identity/rank, reduced toxicity, or improved win rate?
6. What age boundary, launch geography, and language boundary apply?

**Closure evidence:** an owner-approved project brief section containing
purpose, audience, goals, non-goals, permitted uses, prohibited uses, and public
claim limits. This closes or narrows `OQ-004`.

## Decision Group 2 - First User And Market Wedge

1. Which game and mode, if any, is the first supported wedge?
2. Which platform, input, cross-play, region/data center, and language are in
   scope?
3. Is the primary user solo, a partial party, or both?
4. Is the product for a single session, repeat teammates, persistent teams, or
   a deliberate subset?
5. Is the first priority casual, ranked/competitive, or another player need?
6. What team size and availability assumptions apply?

**Closure evidence:** a named primary user, launch context, and explicit
out-of-scope segments. This closes or narrows `OQ-005` and enables current
platform-capability research.

## Decision Group 3 - Smallest Complete MVP Journey

Define the complete user loop before treating features as requirements:

1. Discovery and account requirement.
2. Game identity or profile setup and its truthful accuracy label.
3. Queue, directory, invitation, or other discovery mechanism.
4. Match proposal, acceptance, decline, timeout, no-match, block, and requeue.
5. Coordination room or equivalent, including membership and expiry.
6. Manual or automated in-game party formation.
7. Session completion evidence, if any.
8. Feedback, report, repeat-team, or post-session behavior, if any.
9. Recovery when integrations, another user, or the network fails.

For every step, decide whether it is required for the first validation or
explicitly excluded. A happy-path mockup alone is not a complete journey.

**Closure evidence:** current user-journey and MVP/non-goal records with empty,
failure, permission, abuse, and recovery states.

## Decision Group 4 - Matching And User-Decision Effects

1. Is the experience a neutral directory, deterministic filter, preference
   match, ranked recommendation, or eligibility/screening system?
2. What input is necessary, and why is each input needed?
3. Which rules are hard exclusions versus weighted preferences?
4. Does rank affect display, ordering, eligibility, or nothing?
5. Does any behavior/reputation signal affect display, ordering, eligibility,
   or nothing?
6. How do ties, missing/contradictory inputs, no-match, widening, blocks,
   repeated teammates, and partial parties behave?
7. What explanation and user control accompany a match or no-match result?

**Closure evidence:** approved decision-system classification, criteria
version, deterministic/adversarial fixture outline, explanation behavior,
monitoring, and rollback boundary. This is part of closing `OQ-006`.

## Decision Group 5 - Trust, Reviews, Reports, And Moderation

Choose the lowest-complexity trust model that satisfies the approved product
purpose:

1. No reputation; private structured feedback; endorsements; public score;
   reports; or a bounded combination.
2. Who may review whom, based on what evidence, and how often?
3. Are free text, voice, or game-session events collected? Each materially
   expands privacy and moderation obligations.
4. Can feedback change information, ordering, eligibility, restrictions, or
   account status?
5. What prevents retaliation, brigading, reciprocal boosting, discrimination,
   sock puppets, and score lock-in?
6. What report taxonomy, human review, reason notice, correction, appeal,
   restoration, and emergency/safeguarding path exists?

**Closure evidence:** approved trust/safety boundary, moderation ownership,
abuse tests, explanation/appeal requirements, and any required qualified
review. This is part of closing `OQ-006`.

## Decision Group 6 - Identity, Integrations, And Data

1. Which account and game identifiers are collected, and are they declared,
   confirmed, or verified?
2. Is an official API, third-party service, local relay, manual entry, or no
   integration required for the first version?
3. What minimum data supports each approved purpose?
4. What is shown to matched users, operators, providers, and the public?
5. Where is data processed, logged, and backed up; who can access it; and for
   how long?
6. How do correction, export, deletion, account recovery, legal hold, and
   backup restoration work?
7. What jurisdiction, platform-policy, privacy, security, age, or legal review
   is required for the concrete flow?

**Closure evidence:** field-level data-flow inventory, accuracy labels,
recipient/access map, retention/deletion plan, provider facts, threat-model
boundary, and assigned reviews. This completes `OQ-006` only after the actual
flow is concrete.

## Decision Group 7 - Validation, Business, And Operating Constraints

1. What user behavior or outcome proves the concept is worth continuing?
2. Which metrics are decision-useful: successful groups, time to group,
   acceptance, completed sessions, repeat grouping, reports, retention, or a
   smaller set?
3. What volume, duration, and qualitative feedback constitute a valid test?
4. Is the first version free, paid, sponsored, community-run, or intentionally
   undecided during validation?
5. What budget, delivery horizon, operator capacity, support burden, and
   availability expectation apply?
6. What accessibility, localization, security, incident, backup, restore, and
   rollback expectations are required for the validation stage?

**Closure evidence:** measurable validation hypothesis, failure/stop criteria,
resource constraints, business non-goals, and operational service boundary.

## Decision Group 8 - Technical Specification And Implementation Plan

Only after Groups 1-7 are sufficiently settled:

1. Compare architectures against the approved journey, data flow, risk, and
   operating constraints; do not select a stack for legacy familiarity alone.
2. Decide clean repository/branch strategy and whether any legacy artifact is
   reference-only, migrated, or deliberately reimplemented.
3. Define component boundaries, state machines, contracts, authorization,
   schemas, concurrency, failure recovery, observability, and versioning.
4. Select runtime, framework, database, realtime approach, integrations,
   hosting, environments, secret handling, CI, and deployment/rollback.
5. Define testable completion criteria before dividing work into milestones.
6. Order phases so product validation and reversible work precede expensive or
   irreversible integrations and trust systems.

**Closure evidence:** approved technical specification, risk/review matrix,
phased execution plan, acceptance tests, release gates, rollback plan, and
explicit authorization to begin implementation. This closes `OQ-007`.

## Proposed Low-Dependency Baseline For Owner Reaction

This is an agent proposal only, offered to make tradeoffs concrete:

- one game, one primary mode, and one launch region/language;
- web-first accounts, declared game handle, and a small preference set;
- realtime party discovery with a private coordination room and manual in-game
  invites;
- truthful no-match/decline/timeout/block/requeue states;
- no privileged API, desktop relay, public honor score, free-text reviews,
  automated punishment, or multi-game abstraction in the first validation;
- structured private feedback/reporting only if the owner decides it is needed
  to validate the core value; and
- architecture chosen after the owner accepts this or another product loop.

This baseline reduces dependency and decision-system risk. It also tests less
of the legacy differentiation, so accepting it would require the owner to state
whether behavior-based trust is core now or a later hypothesis.

## Review Method

1. Resolve Gate 0.
2. Review one decision group at a time in the order above.
3. Record exact owner decisions immediately in
   `../governance/decisions.md` and update affected open questions.
4. Research current game/platform/provider facts only after the corresponding
   scope choice makes that research relevant.
5. Do not turn an unanswered item into an assumption inside architecture or
   code.
6. Do not create an implementation plan until all blocking closure evidence is
   present and reconciled.
